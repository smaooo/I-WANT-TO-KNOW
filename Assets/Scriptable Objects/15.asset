      \r\nI did wonder whether I have lost my mind at one point as I was able to
      look into the hearts of the ones around me, I was able to know their emotions,
      thoughts and tastes, and for a second I believed that I have seen the very
      depths of hell. Everything which I have created, everything which has been
      dear to me was a regret\u2026 Or was it really? I was not sure how to think
      of those things anymore, I believed that the beauty of the inside and the outside
      might help those around, but I only saw the evil which it grew in those who
      were cursed with the fourth sin. I never believed in the things which were
      deemed normal, but I started wondering if I am the one who needs to be forgiven,
      I started wondering whether I even knew my place in this thing I have created.
      I started thinking about the concept of death. I thought that maybe I was starting
      to understand of what the others were talking about. I was not able to handle
      being close to them. Oh, did they hurt me\u2026 I thought that it would be
      better for me to lock myself up and write, write about those who have been
      consumed by misfortune and every step which those of them have taken made me
      rage. I would be consumed by anger itself, but once the anger has passed, I
      found myself forgiving them yet again. I believed there for a second that I
      was understanding the term itself \u201CHUMANENESS\u201D.\r\n"
