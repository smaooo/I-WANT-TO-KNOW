  - question: "There lived a human I used to know. That person was close to GOD,
      that person relied on GOD, they always believed in GOD. And then one day, a
      tragedy has occurred. Oh, was it a big tragedy for the human and for the humans
      close to them. The world was not touched by it. But the human believed for
      their tragedy to be of the greatest burden. They started calling to GOD asking
      for their misfortune to go away. When they realized the GOD was not going to
      save them, they started calling, crying out loud. They would scream to the
      CRUEL GOD, they would hate and cry and beg and pray. And when the hatred went
      away and all that was left was the DESPAIR itself, they started asking the
      GOD for a different thing. \r\nThey asked to have just enough time to be able
      to say their farewells. "
