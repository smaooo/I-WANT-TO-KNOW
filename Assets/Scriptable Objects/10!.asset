  - question: "Knowledge it is\u2026I see. Well, let me tell you about the one who
      was deceived by the world around them. That day was full of sorrow\u2026and
      disappointment. \r\nI had someone by my side, they were close, close enough
      to call them the FIRST STANDING NEXT TO ME, but what they desired was what
      I had. And what I had was not something they could obtain. They tried to get
      it from me with all possible means, but I was not in the right to give those
      things up, no matter how problematic and difficult they were. They grew angrier
      and angrier until they have lost the last bit of faith they carried. That sent
      them into the world which is not desired by anyone who is alive or dead. \r\nAnd
      then came the other one, the one who was infatuated by me, the one who would
      praise me again and again behind my shoulders, telling me the things which
      I know to be the truth. That one was the SECOND NEXT TO ME, as they never were
      able to obtain the title of the first. It sent them into insanity as they were
      not able to take up the spot which they wanted. And the words of praise became
      the cries of the one who was not chosen. "
